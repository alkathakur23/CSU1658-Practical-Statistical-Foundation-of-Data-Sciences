# Practical-2
# Problem covered
1.Data Type:
Cross-sectional data (instructors at one time, not over time)

2️ Student Summary:
 Mean ≈ 55.3, Median ≈ 48, Min ≈ 5, Max ≈ 600

3️ Descriptive Stats:
 Use df.describe() table

4️ Beauty Distribution:
Approximately normal, slightly skewed toward lower beauty values

5️ Beauty by Gender:
 Slight difference between male and female means (depends on dataset values)

6️ Tenure by Gender:
 If the male tenure percentage is higher, then yes — tenure status differs by gender
