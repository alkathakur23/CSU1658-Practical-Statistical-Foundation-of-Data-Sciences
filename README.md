# Practical-2
## Problem covered
1.Data Type:
Cross-sectional data (instructors at one time, not over time)

2️ Student Summary:
 Mean ≈ 55.3, Median ≈ 48, Min ≈ 5, Max ≈ 600

3️ Descriptive Stats:
 Use df.describe() table

4️ Beauty Distribution:
Approximately normal, slightly skewed toward lower beauty values

5️ Beauty by Gender:
 Slight difference between male and female means (depends on dataset values)

6️ Tenure by Gender:
 If the male tenure percentage is higher, then yes — tenure status differs by gender

 ## Tech Stack
 
Python -	Programming language

pandas-	For data cleaning, mean, median, etc.

numpy-	For numerical calculations

matplotlib / seaborn-	For plotting histograms & charts

Jupyter Notebook - To run code interactively


# Practical-3

## Problem Covered
1 Duplicates & Age Statistics

Duplicates: Exist because a professor can teach multiple courses.

All observations:

Average age ≈ 48.3 years

Standard deviation ≈ 10.3

Filtered dataset (one observation per professor, n=94):

Average age ≈ 48.5 years

Standard deviation ≈ 9.9

2️ Lower vs Upper Division Evaluations (Bar Chart)

Lower division instructors receive slightly higher average teaching evaluations than upper division instructors.

3️ Relationship between Age and Teaching Evaluation

Scatter plot shows no strong correlation; evaluation scores are fairly consistent across ages.

4️ Gender-Differentiated Scatter Plot (Age vs Evaluation)

Male and female instructors overlap heavily; gender does not strongly affect evaluations.

5️ Scatter Plot Differentiated by Gender & Tenure

No major impact of tenure or gender on teaching evaluation scores; scores are fairly evenly distributed across groups.
