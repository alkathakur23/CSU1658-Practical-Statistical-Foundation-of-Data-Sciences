#1️) T-TEST
## Problem Statement:

Using the Teachers’ Rating dataset, determine whether gender affects teaching evaluation scores.

## Objective:

To compare the mean evaluation scores of male and female instructors.

 ##Hypotheses:

H₀: Mean evaluation scores for males and females are equal.

H₁: Mean evaluation scores for males and females are different.

 ##Test Used:

Independent Samples T-Test (scipy.stats.ttest_ind)

 ##Output Interpretation:

If p < 0.05, then gender significantly affects teaching evaluation ratings.


#2️) ANOVA TEST
## Problem Statement:

Using the Teachers’ Rating dataset, determine whether beauty scores of instructors differ by age group.

## Objective:

To test if the mean beauty score is significantly different across multiple age groups (e.g., Young, Middle, Old).

## Hypotheses:

H₀: All age groups have equal mean beauty scores.

H₁: At least one age group has a different mean beauty score.

## Test Used:

One-Way ANOVA (scipy.stats.f_oneway)

## Output Interpretation:

If p < 0.05, then beauty scores significantly differ among age groups.

 #3️) CHI-SQUARE TEST
## Problem Statement:

Using the Teachers’ Rating dataset, test whether there is an association between tenure and gender.

## Objective:

To see if being tenured (Yes/No) is related to gender (Male/Female).

## Hypotheses:

H₀: Gender and tenure are independent (no relationship).

H₁: Gender and tenure are associated.

## Test Used:

Chi-Square Test of Independence (scipy.stats.chi2_contingency)

## Output Interpretation:

If p < 0.05, then tenure and gender have a significant association.

# 4️)CORRELATION ANALYSIS
## Problem Statement:

Using the Teachers’ Rating dataset, determine whether teaching evaluation scores are correlated with beauty scores.

## Objective:

To measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between evaluation and beauty scores.

## Hypotheses:

H₀: There is no correlation between evaluation and beauty.

H₁: There is a correlation between evaluation and beauty.

## Test Used:

Pearson Correlation Coefficient (scipy.stats.pearsonr)

## Output Interpretation:

r > 0: Positive correlation (as beauty ↑, evaluation ↑)

r < 0: Negative correlation

|r| close to 1: Strong correlation

p < 0.05: Correlation is statistically significant
