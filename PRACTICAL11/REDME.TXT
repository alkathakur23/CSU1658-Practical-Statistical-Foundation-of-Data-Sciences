##Workflow-
Step 1 — Load and Prepare the Data
	Import the monthly sunspot dataset (1749–2018).
	Remove missing or invalid values.
	Create a time index in months (or convert to year values).
	Extract the column containing the monthly mean sunspot number.

Step 2 — Plot the Time Series
	Plot the monthly sunspot numbers against time.
	Observe periodic waves (~11-year solar cycle).
	Check visually for long-term trends or unusual spikes.

Step 3 — Histogram of Sunspot Values
	Create a histogram of all sunspot values.
	Inspect right-skewness (Gamma-like behavior).
	This motivates using the Gamma distribution for modeling.

Step 4 — Segment Data into 12-Year Cycles
	A solar cycle ≈ 11 years, but you reset the model every 12 years.
	Compute the number of months per cycle:
144 months = 12 × 12
	Split the full dataset into consecutive 144-month blocks.
	Treat each block as a separate realization of the Gamma process.

Step 5 — Fit Gamma Model (Cycle-wise MLE)
For each 12-year cycle:
	Fit a Gamma distribution:
	Shape parameter a
	Scale parameter b
	Use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
	Store and compare (a,b)values across cycles.
	Observe whether different cycles show similar shapes or scales.

Step 6 — MCMC Modeling (Bayesian Estimation)
You run MCMC for:
	First 50 observations
	All observations
	Last 50 observations
The workflow is:
	Choose priors for shape aand scale b(center around a=4,b=10).
	Set up a Gamma likelihood for the observed sunspot numbers.
	Run MCMC:
	Draw many samples of aand b
	Include a “burn-in” tuning phase to stabilize chains.
	Store the posterior samples of aand b.

Step 7 — Trace Plots & Posterior Histograms
For each dataset (first50, all, last50):
	Plot MCMC traces of parameters aand b:
	Check mixing
	Check convergence
	Discard burn-in (first ~500 samples).
	Plot posterior histograms of parameters.
	Summarize posterior means, medians, 95% credible intervals.

Step 8 — Posterior Predictive Checks
	Use posterior samples of aand bto simulate future sunspot values.
	Compare:
	Empirical histogram of observed data
	Histogram of posterior predictive data
	Assess how well the Gamma model fits the sunspot distribution.

Step 9 — Interpretation
	Inspect how aand bchange across cycles.
	Higher a⋅b= higher average sunspot activity.
	Posterior predictive distributions show model uncertainty.
	MCMC summaries provide inference on:
	The underlying solar cycle intensity
	Variability from cycle to cycle
