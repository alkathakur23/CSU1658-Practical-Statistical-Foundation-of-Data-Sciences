Language / Environment: Python (Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab) — useful if you later want to compute values.

Libraries (optional): Pandas (data handling), NumPy / SciPy (statistics), Matplotlib (plots).

Concepts used: empirical probability (relative frequency), distributional reasoning, two-tailed hypothesis testing, significance level and p-value.

# Problem Solution
Part A — Probabilities from the rating dataset (teacher evaluation scores)

Data context: the dataset column is rating (evaluation scores), each record is one teacher’s score.

1) Probability of getting an evaluation score greater than 4.5

How to get it (plain steps, no formulas):

Count how many teacher records have a rating above 4.5.

Count the total number of records.

The probability is the proportion of records above 4.5 out of the total.
Interpretation: This proportion tells you how likely it is, when you pick a random teacher from the dataset, to get a rating above 4.5. 
Report the proportion as a percentage to make it easy to interpret.

2) Probability of getting an evaluation score greater than 3.5 and less than 4.2

How to get it (plain steps):

Count records with ratings strictly between 3.5 and 4.2.

Divide that count by the total number of records to obtain the probability (relative frequency).
Interpretation: This proportion tells you how common ratings in that middle range are in the dataset.

Notes on method choice:

The empirical (count / total) method is preferred because it uses the actual data and makes no distributional assumptions.

You may optionally approximate these probabilities with a normal model if the ratings appear roughly bell-shaped and you want a parametric answer, but that requires checking the distribution first.

Part B — Two-tailed test (players scoring example) — plain language

Scenario given:

Historical average score for professional players is 12 points per game, with a known variability measure (standard deviation) of 5.5.

A sample of 36 regional players has an average of 10.7 points per game.

The coach wants to know whether the regional players’ average is different from the historic average.

Stated hypotheses (verbatim, as you requested)

Null hypothesis: "The mean point of the regional player is not different from the historic mean."
(Standard statistical form: the regional mean equals the historic mean.)

Alternative hypothesis: "The mean point of the regional player is different from the historic mean."

Testing approach (plain-language steps, no formulas)

Choose a significance level (commonly 5%). This defines how strong the evidence must be before you conclude the means differ.

Use the known historic variability and the sample size to determine how far the sample average is from the historic average in standard-error
terms (this is the standard decision procedure when population variability is known).

Translate that distance into a probability (p-value) that such a difference would arise by chance if the true mean were the historic value.

Compare the p-value to the chosen significance level:

If the p-value is smaller than the significance level, conclude there is a statistically significant difference (reject the null).

If the p-value is larger, conclude there is not enough evidence to say the means differ (fail to reject the null).

Result interpretation for the given numbers (plain language conclusion)

With the given sample average (10.7), sample size (36), and known historical variability (5.5), the analysis yields a p-value that is larger than 0.05 (approximately 0.16).

Since this p-value is greater than the common 5% threshold, we do not have sufficient evidence to say the regional players’ average is different 
from the historic average.

Conclusion (plain English): The difference between 10.7 and the historic 12 points per game could plausibly be due to random variation; therefore, we cannot conclude that the regional players’ scoring average is different from the historic pro average.

Practical reporting checklist (what to write in your answer)

For the rating probabilities: report the counts and the resulting percentages (e.g., “X out of N, which is Y%”). Always show the raw counts and N so 
the reader can see the basis of the probability.

For the hypothesis test: state the null and alternative exactly as above, state the significance level used (e.g., 5%), give the p-value
(rounded reasonably, e.g., 0.16), and then state the decision and plain-language interpretation (fail to reject; no evidence of difference).
