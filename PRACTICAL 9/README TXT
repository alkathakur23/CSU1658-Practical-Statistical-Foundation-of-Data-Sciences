Workflow-
Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Understand the dataset structure, summary statistics, and class distribution.
Tasks:
	Load the Iris dataset
	Display the first few rows using head()
	Generate statistical summary using describe()
	Group the data by species using groupby() to compare means of each feature across classes.


Step 2: Feature Scaling
Objective: Bring all numerical features to the same scale so that no feature dominates distance calculations.
Tasks:
	Use StandardScaler to normalize numerical columns.
	Convert features into standardized form
z=(x-μ)/σ
Step 3: Train–Test Split & Model Training
Objective: Train the KNN model using training data.
Tasks:
	Split data using train_test_split() (typically 70% train, 30% test).
	Define KNN classifier with initial K=5
	Fit the classifier on training data.

Step 4: Confusion Matrix & Accuracy
Objective: Evaluate the classifier.
Tasks:
	Predict the test values using the trained model.
	Generate Confusion Matrix.
	Calculate Accuracy Score.
Step 5: Classification Report
Objective: Get a detailed performance summary.
Tasks:
	Create a classification_report including:
Precision
 Recall
 F1-score
 Support (number of samples per class)

Step 6: Compare Error Rates for Different K
Objective: Find how the number of neighbors (K) affects model performance.
Tasks:
	Iterate K from 1 to 20.
	Train a model for each K.
	Measure error rate = (wrong predictions / total predictions).
	Store error values for each K.

Step 7: Plot Error Rate vs K
Objective: Visually identify the best K.
Tasks:
	Plot line graph with
	X-axis → K values
	Y-axis → Error rate
	Look for the K where error rate is minimum.

Step 8: Finding the Best K
Objective: Choose the optimum K value for the final model.
Tasks:
	Identify minimum-error K from the plot.
	Re-train KNN using best K.

Step 9: Visualize Test Results
Objective: Graphically show how KNN classified test samples.
Tasks:
	Choose two features (e.g., sepal length & width).
	Plot a scatter plot of test data with predicted class colors.
	Helps visualize decision-making of KNN.
