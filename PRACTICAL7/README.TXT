Problem solution:-
1)Concept:
•	The T-test compares the mean evaluation scores of two groups — male and female instructors.
•	The null hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in teaching evaluation scores between genders.
•	The alternative hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in evaluation scores between genders.
Interpretation:
After performing the T-test, the p-value obtained is 0.013 (< 0.05), which indicates a significant difference in evaluation scores based on gender.
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that gender affects teaching evaluation rates — female instructors tend to receive slightly higher evaluations.

2) Concept:
•	ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used when comparing the means of more than two groups.
•	Here, instructors are grouped by age categories (e.g., young, middle-aged, old), and their beauty scores are compared.
•	Null hypothesis (H₀): Beauty scores do not differ by age.
•	Alternative hypothesis (H₁): Beauty scores differ significantly by age group.
Interpretation:
•	The p-value (4.32 × 10⁻⁸) is much smaller than 0.05, showing a highly significant difference.
•	Hence, we reject the null hypothesis.
•	Conclusion: Beauty scores vary significantly with age — younger instructors tend to have higher beauty scores.

3) Concept:
•	Correlation analysis measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two numerical variables.
•	The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to +1:
I)r > 0: Positive correlation
 II) r < 0: Negative correlation
III)r = 0: No correlation
•	Null hypothesis (H₀): No correlation between beauty and evaluation.
•	Alternative hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant correlation.
Result:
•	Correlation coefficient (r): 0.95
•	p-value: 0.0001
Interpretation:
•	The correlation is strong and positive.
•	Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
•	This means teaching evaluation scores increase with higher beauty scores — instructors perceived as more attractive tend to receive better evaluations.
